            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p id="overview-desc">The Buddha lived during the 6th century BCE and traveled throughout the region of what is present-day North India and Nepal. He was born to a royal family of high standing, but decided to renounce this lifestyle at age 29 in order to find the antidote to suffering. After many years of searching, he finally attained enlightenment at age 36. He then spent the remaining 44 years of his life spreading his teachings. Now, over 2,500 years later, Buddhism has spread far and wide, with over 520 million followers (comprising 7% of the world population), making it the world's 4th largest religion. Please note that as the Buddha lived so long ago, records of his life are far from accurate and often mixed with legend. What you'll find below is a rough approximation of his life timeline.</p>
